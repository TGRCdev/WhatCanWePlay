This document describes what information we collect, how we use it, and how we store it.
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>
        <h3>1.1 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        When you visit our website, we log the following information.
        <ul>
            <li>Your IP address</li>
            <li>The web page you are trying to access</li>
            <li>The browser you are using</li>
            <li>The date and time</li>
        </ul>
        Most websites log this information. We will never link this data to individual user identities, such as Steam IDs.

    <dt>
        <h3>1.2 Information Given By Steam</h3>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        When you sign in with Steam, Steam provides us with the following information about you through the Steam Web API.
        <ul>
            <li>Your Steam ID</li>
            <li>Your Steam screen name</li>
            <li>A link to your avatar picture</li>
            <li>The Steam games you own</li>
        </ul>
        This information is retrieved solely to make the web app function. We can only retrieve this information if your Steam profile visibility is set to Public.<br/>
        <br/>
        Steam also provides us the following information about the users on your Friends List through the Steam API.
        <ul>
            <li>Their Steam IDs</li>
            <li>Their Steam screen names</li>
            <li>Links to their avatar pictures</li>
            <li>The Steam games they own</li>
        </ul>
        Again, this information is only used to make the app function, and can only be retrieved if your friends' profiles have their visibility set to Public.<br/>
        <br/>
        Your personal information is encrypted and stored on your browser. We fetch your friends' information from Steam when you use the app. We never store personal data on our servers.<br/>
    </dd>
</dl>
<h2>2. Information We Store</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><h3>2.1 Cookies</h3></dt>
    <dd>
        When you sign in with Steam, we store your Steam information in a small file on your browser called a "cookie". This cookie contains the following information.
        <ul>
            <li>Your Steam ID</li>
            <li>Your Steam screen name</li>
            <li>A link to your avatar picture</li>
        </ul>
        This information is stored so you do not have to log in every single time you want to use the app's functions.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you want to stop providing WhatCanWePlay with your Steam information, you can click "Sign Out" on the web app interface, or <a href="steam_logout">click here</a>. Both methods will delete the cookie from your browser and prevent us from using your information any further. You can also manually delete the cookie, labeled "steam_info", using methods provided by your browser.
    </dd>
    <dt><h3>2.2 Game Info</h3></dt>
    <dd>
        When you use the app to find games, we take the App IDs of the games you and your friends own and fetch the following information from the <a href="https://www.igdb.com">IGDB</a>.
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the game</li>
            <li>A link to a banner picture for the game</li>
            <li>A list of tags associated with the game</li>
            <li>The gamemodes that the game supports (i.e. Singleplayer, Multiplayer)</li>
            <li>The number of players supported by the Multiplayer mode, if supported.</li>
        </ul>
        None of this information is personally linked to you or your friends in any way. This information is stored on our servers to reduce the number of requests we make to the <a href="https://www.igdb.com">IGDB</a>.
    </dd>
